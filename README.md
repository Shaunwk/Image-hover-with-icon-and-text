I made this repo to remind myself how to do a hover color over an image. Also, inside the hover color there is a icon and text. 

To control the opacity of the color overlay on hover use hsla on the overlay color and set opacity. This keeps the text and icon at full opacity and only affects the background hover color. 

Borders have a interesting shape just using boarder radius.

Overlay gets position:absolute and the div holding the img gets position:relative
